### CS50 - final project

Django Mibrary is my final assignment/project to complete CS50X. This project is a culmination of the final few projects from the web track. 

I decided to take several months to learn Django after some frustration with Flask and some of its limitations. I made the decision to extend the amount of time it would take me to complete the course in order to let yet another new technology during the class. It's something the professor and his assistants encouraged as we jumped from language to language by learning to pick up patterns a lot more quickly.

Mibrary allows users to register, login, create/edit a profile page, create/edit user settings and create/edit books as well as viewing other users profiles, books and leaving reviews for other user books.

The app also uses static content for a minimal amount of image along with all user uploaded images being saved and loaded from Cloudinary for storage.
